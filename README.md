# SurfCooker

- SurfCooker is a youtube VLoger that posts content about surf/skimboard adventures and cooking/barbecue. People like to follow SurfCooker for the surf and skimboarding content but people also love making the meals that surfcooker makes in his videos. 

- My idea is to pull in current surf/weather forecast data and display it, updated daily. 

- The forecast will display temperature in fahrenheit, sun, rain, or clouds, and wave height based on location. Based on the API I can get, the data will either be set to one location, (Dewey Beach, DE) or users can put in a zipcode and it will pull data based on the zipcode.

- Based on the weather/surf forecast for the day, a recommended cuisine to make for the day will be recommended by Surf Cooker. For example, if the weather is sunny, and temperature is between 70-80 degrees fahrenheit, the program may recommend cooking one of Surf Cooker's bbq or fish meals. When you click on the cuisine, it will display dishes that Surf Cooker makes along with a recipe. If the weather is cloudy, and raining, regardless of the termperature outside, it may recommend comfort food and it will give a list of comfort food meals Surf Cooker makes along with recipes. And so on.


API's to choose from:

- https://magicseaweed.com/developer/API
    - This is supposedly the best free and open to public API for surf forecast however you still need a key to get in. I sent magic seaweed an email explaining it will be used only for educational puropses and am still waiting to hear back.
- https://github.com/swrobel/meta-surf-forecast/issues/15
    - I contacted surfline to see if they could hook me up with any data that could help me in this project. Somebody in 2018 was able to find surflines hidden API through developer tools but they have since fixed their security issues it seems.

    - I just found this which may be exactly what I need if I can't get data from magic seaweed/surfline. I will also look into NOAA.gov
- https://www.weatherapi.com/
    - This will be my backup plan, if I can't get surf forecast I will use current weather data.
